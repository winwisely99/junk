# flamed

flamed has i think what we need:

Clustering
- I have not worked out yet how to run 3 on my latop.

Importable
- Obviously i hope we can import flamed.
- It has a good config generator, which makes it easier to import into another higher level go package, and then boot it up.
Can we write badger DB code on top of it ?

GRPC
- We need to use GRPC in golang and Flutter, but not sure it can do it. Depends on if its importable.

- Its GraphQL could be useful for the Flutter Admin area.
