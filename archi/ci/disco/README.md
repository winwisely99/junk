THis is about a few things:

1. Management upgrades when you have more than one server
- Needed for when you need to run upgrades and upgrade serevrs in the right order, and avoid download

2. Discovery for each server to find each other
- Need for running in HA mode and finding each other.

3. Managing data snapshots and backup.


Basically you need a central place for managing things.
Essentially its about jobs.
